The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with SQL, SQL queries and Tableau visualizations.

The two excel files I used in order to create the SQL tables can't be imported on Github because they are too heavy, but I downloaded the data on this website : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

covid.ipynb is a python file used to create the SQL tables from the two excel files.

covid.sql contains all the queries used for this project

Finally, I made a dashboard using Tableau with some visualizations about covid. The Tableau dashboard can be found here : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dani.halegua/viz/CovidDashboard_16847921448090/Tableaudebord1?publish=yes
